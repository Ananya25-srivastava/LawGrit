            <h4>Introduction</h4>
 <p>Our Indian Constitution is a mirror which reflects various democratic and welfare principles and these principles have been well adapted in our Country to combat the situation of poverty, inequality and to accelerate economic growth.<br><br> Long before Article 31 was repealed by the 44th amendment in the year 1978, Article 31B was one such addition to the Constitution which was introduced by our draughtsmen under Nehru’s regiment to revamp India’s reforms on land and agriculture but as soon after being introduced it was dressed down and severely criticized by the citizens of the Country.</p>

            <h3>conclusion  of Article 31B</h3>
            <br>
        
            <br>
           
            <ul>
                The objective behind the insertion of Article 31B might have been great on papers but in reality, it gave a huge amount of power to the Legislature, who not to anybody’s surprise tried to misuse it to achieve their political goals. Rendering unnecessary authority to the draft makers who can easily incorporate void and illegal Acts into the Constitution certainly has its ill effects especially on the farmers, whose privilege to approach the custodians of Fundamental Rights i.e the supreme Court and High Court has been snatched because of this ‘draconian article’.<br><br>Moreover, this provision has been used many times to shield even those acts which are not related to agrarian reforms.

The opinion of the Parliament was that the Land reform programmes shared a deeper nexus with Fundamental Right of right to property and therefore excluded the subject of Agrarian Reforms from Judicial review. But now, one may ask that after omission of right to property as a Fundamental Right, do we really need to seclude laws of Ninth Schedule from being challenged in the Court or shouldn’t the Parliament have come up with certain guidelines or alterations to use the powers conferred by this Article after the Right to Property was omitted? <br><br>

One of the simple answers can be that Parliament wanted to show its supremacy by altering the Constitution and thereby giving itself superfluous privileges over Judiciary. This can be projected as disloyalty on the part of the Parliament as it not only affects the identity of the Constitution but also imposes a great threat to democracy.

This unbridled and pervasive power has eroded the original intent of the Legislature to bring about social and economic changes and has rather created a paradoxical situation where some acts are safeguarded and cannot be challenged ever after contradicting the touchstone of the Constitution.
