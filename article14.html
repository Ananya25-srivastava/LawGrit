            <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>Every human being is born equally and therefore the makers of the Indian Constitution had also made provision for equality of the people. Article 14 is one of the most important Articles of the Indian constitution and it is also regarded as part of the golden triangle of the Constitution along with Article-19 and 21.</p>
           <br>
            
        <p>In India, this right is very important because there has been a widespread socio-economic difference which has been in existence from a long time. People have been discriminated on the basis of their gender or the religion they follow, therefore Article 14 was included in the Constitution to remove such inequalities and bring all the people under the equal protection of the law.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Article 14 is the embodiment of equality which has been provided in the Preamble. Another important point about this Article is that it not only imposes a duty on the State to abstain from discriminating people but it also puts a positive duty to take such action by which the inequalities can be bridged between the people.</p>

            <h3>Article 14 Of Constitution of India</h3>
            <br>
           <p>Article 14 guarantees all citizens equality before law and equal protection of law. Moreover, Article 14 manifests in the form of following propositions:
            <br>
            <br>
            “Article 14 is an authority for the proposition that the principles of natural justice are an integral part of the guarantee of equality assured by Article 14 an order depriving a person of his civil right passed without affording him an opportunity of being heard suffers from the vice of violation of natural justice.”  
          </p>
             <li> In other words, it comprises of the following:</li>
            <br>
           
            <ul>
              <li> <span></span> A law granting freehand and unhindered power on an authority is dreadful for being arbitrary and discriminatory.</li>
              <li> <span>Article 14 illegalize prejudice in the definite exercise of any discretionary power.</span></li>
              <li><span>Article 14 smacks at arbitrariness in administrative action and guarantees fairness and equality of treatment.</span></li>
            </ul>
       <p>On the basis of above discussed case laws with respect to Constitution of India and principles of natural justice it can be concluded that though the principles of natural justice are no were specifically defined under legislation but it has its roots embedded under the judicial system by means of judicial pronouncements.<br><br> Moreover, Article 14 strikes at arbitrariness in administrative action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment, it is an authority for the proposition that the principles of natural justice are an integral part of the guarantee of equality assured by Article 14.<br><br> Therefore, Article 14 acts as a key ingredient of the principles of natural justice.</p>
