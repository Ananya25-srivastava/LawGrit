            <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>The essence of every country lies in education, and without it, the country fails to survive. As a result, the cornerstone of the country is education. It is crucial for the overall growth and effective operation of a democracy. <br><br>Education helps people become more skilled and more likeable, and as they grow, so does the country. It aims to achieve a wide range of goals ranging from employment to that of human resource development, general improvement, and bringing about much-needed social environment change. It provides residents of a nation with personal freedom and empowerment, thereby contributing to the development of an independent individual. It is regarded as the societal cornerstone that supports political stability, social progress, and economic prosperity. After food, clothing, and shelter a person’s fourth essential necessity is education. It is the foundation upon which society is built.<br><br> Social justice and equality are made possible only by means of education. Article 21A of the Indian Constitution, which was inserted into the Constitution by means of the Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002, mandates every state to provide free and compulsory education to all children in the age group of six to fourteen years, thereby declaring education as a fundamental right guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. This amendment is a major milestone in the country’s aim to achieve ‘Education for All’. The government stated this step as ‘The dawn of the second revolution in the chapter of citizens rights’. This article explores this provision with respect to society, the judiciary, and other provisions of the Constitution in general. </p>

            <h3>Meaning of Article 21(A)</h3>
            <br>
           <p>Article 21 of the Indian Constitution states that,
              <li> In other words, it comprises of the following:</li>
            <br>
           
            <ul>
           <li><span>Every child has the right to a full-time elementary education of adequate and equitable quality in a formal school that complies with certain fundamental norms and standards, thanks to the addition of Article 21A in Part III of the Indian Constitution.</span></li>
        <li><span>The language of Article 45 went through modification to Article 45 as it was replaced with the statement that the “State shall work to ensure early childhood care and free and mandatory education for all children up to the age of six”.</span></li>   
       <li><span>The addition of a new clause to Article 51 A makes it explicitly mandatory for parents or guardians to provide opportunities for their children between the ages of 6 and 14 to receive an education [Article 51A (k)]. </span></li>
    </ul>
       <p>One of the most important pieces of legislation in Indian history to ensure that children receive a basic education is the amendment to the fundamental right to education.<br><br> The nation’s future lies with its children. Education is therefore a tool for introducing a child to cultural values, preparing him for future professional training, and assisting him in making a normal adjustment to his surroundings. A child today cannot succeed in life without education. The fundamental right to education applies to everyone equally. The most crucial component of higher education is therefore elementary education.</p>
