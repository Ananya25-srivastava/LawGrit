            <h4>Introduction</h4>
     <p>Article 31 Indian Constitution 1949: The Indian Constitution safeguards the fundamental rights of its citizens, and one such aspect was the right to property, which was originally enshrined under Articles 19 and 31.<br><br> These fundamental rights are protected by the supreme law of the land, which is the Constitution. In the past, the right to property, as articulated in Articles 19 and 31, held the status of a fundamental right. However, it has since been reclassified as a human right and a constitutional right.

        Article 31 Indian Constitution 1949 consists of two clauses.<br><br> The first clause deals with the acquisition of property by the State, while the second clause deals with the compensation to be paid to the owner of the property.

        Clause 1 of Article 31 Indian Constitution 1949 states that no person shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law. This means that the State can acquire property only by enacting a law that provides for such acquisition.<br><br> The law must be a valid law, which means that it must be within the legislative competence of the authority that enacts it.
        
        Clause 2 of Article 31 Indian Constitution 1949 states that when the State acquires property, it must pay compensation to the owner.<br><br> The compensation must be a fair and just amount, determined in accordance with the principles laid down in the law. The law must provide for the determination of the amount of compensation, and the principles on which it is based.

            <h3>Meaning of Article 31</h3>
            <br>
         <p></p>
            <li> In other words, it comprises of the following:</li>
            <br>
           
            <ul>
          <li><span>The State cannot deprive any person of his/her property except by the authority of law</span></li>
          <li><span>The State can acquire any property for public purposes, but it has to provide fair compensation to the owner</span></li>
          <li><span>In case of any dispute over compensation, the matter can be taken to the court of law</span></li>
          <li><span>The compensation should be determined by taking into account the market value of the property, and the factors such as its location, potential use, and other relevant considerations</span></li>
          <li><span>The right to property is no longer a fundamental right and can be taken away by the State through a constitutional amendment</span></li>
          <li><span>The state has the power to make laws to regulate or restrict the use of property in the public interest</span></li>
          <li><span>The state can also acquire or requisition property for the use of the state or for public purposes</span></li>
            
        </ul>
 
 <p>Finally, the Minerva Mills Ltd v. Union of India case of 1980 established that the governmentâ€™s power to acquire private property was subject to judicial review and that the compensation offered must be fair and reasonable. <br><br>Overall, these case laws have helped to clarify and strengthen property rights in India, ensuring that citizens are protected from arbitrary deprivation of their assets by the government</p>
