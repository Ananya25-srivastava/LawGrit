            <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Article 22 constituted within the right to freedom is one of the parts of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the constitution. This article is covered in two major parts, protection and rights granted in case of arbitrary arrest also known as punitive detention, and safeguards against preventive detention. The main difference is that whether a person is charged with a crime or not. In case of detention, the person is not accused of any crime but is restricted on a reasonable suspicion while in case of arrest the person is charged for a crime.<br><br>

            This article has always been a topic for debates as it is a contradiction to the freedom guaranteed by Article 21, dealing with the right to life and liberty. The article was originally brought in to safeguard society against undermining of sanctity of the constitution but it rather curtailed the freedom of the masses. The subject matter of this article has always remained very arbitrary and open to interpretation which makes it difficult for the article to attain absolute stability within the constitutional framework.<br><br> It has frequently been attacked in the history of India, with pointers towards the worst excesses of emergency in 1975 as an example of the misuse which Article 22 allows. In recent developments, this article has again become a topic of discussion with regard to the mass protests taking place in the country, dissenting against the citizenship amendment bill.</p>

            <h3>Meaning of Article 22</h3>
            <br>
           <p>Article 22 of the Indian Constitution states that,
              <li> In other words, it comprises of the following:</li>
            <br>
           
            <ul>
          <li><span>No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult, and to be defended by, a legal practitioner of his choice.</span></li>
         <li><span> Every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within twenty-four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate.</span></li>
        <li><span>Nothing in clauses (1) and (2) shall apply –
<br>
            (a) to any person who for the time being is an enemy alien; or
            (b) to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention.</span></li>    
        <li><span> No law providing for preventive detention shall authorize the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless –
<br>
            (a) an Advisory Board consisting of persons who are, or have been, or are qualified to be appointed as Judges of a High Court has reported before the expiration of the said period of three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention:
            Provided that nothing in this sub-clause shall authorize the detention of any person beyond the maximum period prescribed by any law made by Parliament under sub-clause (b) of clause (7); or
            (b) such a person is detained by the provisions of any law made by Parliament under sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (7).</span></li>
        
        <li><span>When any person is detained in pursuance of an order made under any law providing for preventive detention, the authority making the order shall, as soon as may be, communicate to such person the grounds on which the order has been made and shall afford him the earliest opportunity of making a representation against the order.</span></li>
        
    <li><span> Nothing in clause (5) shall require the authority making any such order as is referred to in that clause to disclose facts which such authority considers to be against the public interest to disclose.</span></li>
   <li><span>Parliament may by law prescribe –
<br>
    (a) the circumstances under which, and the class or classes of cases in which, a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of an Advisory Board by the provisions of sub-clause (a) of clause (4);
    (b) the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention; and
    (c) the procedure to be followed by an Advisory Board in an inquiry under sub-clause (a) of clause (4).</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Through this article we observe that preventive detention as a provision has always lacked the element of ‘check and balance’ over its establishment and practice.<br><br> This provision has never aligned itself with any international human rights policies and till date continues to contradict them in some form or the other. A major concern of preventive detention is that it is a very wide provision, without any mention of specifications and limitations, which exposes it to a wider context of interpretation thereby vesting major power in the hands of authority. Hence, this provision in our constitution requires effective and deep rooted study and survey of the root cause and accordingly framing of the appropriate law which also provide for efficient and necessary check and limitation mechanisms to prevent its unjust and unconstitutional use in any scenario.</p>
