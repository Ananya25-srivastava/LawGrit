            <h4>Introduction</h4>
           <p>Fundamental rights are a group of rights which are guaranteed to all the citizens of the nation  by   the Constitution of India under Part III. These rights apply universally to all citizens residing in the nation, irrespective of their race, place of birth, religion, caste or gender.They are recognized by law as rights requiring a high degree of protection from the government and they cannot be violated by the Government.
            <br>
            <br>
            The obligation of protecting these rights lies on the government or the state or its authorities.

            Most of the Fundamental rights provided to the citizens are claimed against the State and its instrumentalities and not against the private bodies. Article 12 gives an extended significance to the term ‘state’. It is very important to determine what bodies fall under the definition of a state so as to determine on whom the responsibility has to be placed.<br> </p>
          
          <p>The framers of the Constitution used the words ‘the State’ in a wider sense than what is understood in the ordinary or narrower sense. It does not merely mean the states in the Union. The word ‘includes’ in the article shows that the definition is not exhaustive and through judicial interpretations, the court has widened the scope of the Article way beyond what even the framers of Article 12 may have had in mind during the framing of the constitution.</p>

          <h3>Meaning of State under Article 12</h3>
            <br>
           <p>Article 12 of the Indian Constitution states that,

            “Definition in this part, unless the context otherwise requires, the State includes the Government and Parliament of India and the Government and the Legislature of each of the States and all local or other authorities within the territory of India or under the control of the Government of India.”
            </p>
             <li> In other words, for the purposes of Part III of the constitution, the state comprises of the following:</li>
            <br>
           
            <ul>
              <li> <span></span> Government and Parliament of India i.e the Executive and Legislature of the Union</li>
              <li> <span> All local or other authorities within the territory of India</span></li>
              <li><span>Government and Legislature of each State i.e the Executive and Legislature of the various States of India</span></li> 
               <li><span>All local and other authorities who are under the control of the Government of India</span></li>
            </ul>
           <p>The term ‘other authorities’ in Article 12 has nowhere been defined. Neither in the Constitution nor in the general clauses Act, 1897 nor in any other statute of India. Therefore, its interpretation has caused a good deal of difficulty, and judicial opinion has undergone changes over time.<br>
            </p>

           <p>The functions of a government can be performed either the governmental departments and officials or through autonomous bodies which exist outside the departmental structure. Such autonomous bodies may include companies, corporations etc.
            
            So, for the purpose of determining what ‘other authorities’ fall under the scope of State, the judiciary has given several judgements as per the facts and circumstances of different cases.</p>
